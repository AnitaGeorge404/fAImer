## Technical Implementation

### 1. Voice Navigation Flow

```
User Speech
  → Web Speech API
  → routeFromTranscript()
  → Gemini AI Intent Parsing (online)
  → OR offlineMatch() (offline fallback)
  → VoiceDecision object
  → handleVoiceNavigation()
  → Route to feature + sub-action
```

### 2. VoiceDecision Object

```typescript
{
  action: "navigate" | "weather" | "chatbot",
  targetId: string,           // Feature ID
  subAction?: string,          // Tab ID for multi-tab features
  confidence: number,          // 0-1 confidence score
  queryNormalized: string,     // Processed query
  reasoningChain?: string      // AI reasoning explanation
}
```

### 3. Updated Files
